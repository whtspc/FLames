FLames (FLOW + games) is a game jam concept focused on creating games using Salesforce Flow Builder. This repository provides resources, components, and inspiration for building games with Flow, while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with this low-code automation tool.

## What is FLames?

FLames creates an environment where participants can develop their Salesforce automation and development skills by creating games within Flow Builder. Just like a musical jam session, FLames encourages experimentation and collaboration with minimal preparation.

### Key Aspects

- **Time-boxed**: Complete your game within a set timeframe
- **Themed**: Work within creative constraints to spark innovation
- **Tool-restricted**: Build exclusively with Flow Builder
- **Presentation**: Share your creation with fellow participants

## Components

This repository includes several Flow components specifically designed for game development:

- **AutoNext**: A non-visual component that automatically triggers the "Next" button in screen flows based on conditions
- **CutScreen**: [Documentation in progress]
- **GridDisplay**: A visual component for displaying text/rich-text content in a 2D grid layout

## Game Mechanics Ideas

Here are some game types you could build:
- Text Adventures
- Quiz Games
- Escape Rooms
- Higher/Lower Games
- Memory Games
- Battle Systems
- Mad Libs
- Slot Machines
- And many more!
